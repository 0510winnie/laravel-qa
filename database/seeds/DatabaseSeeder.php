        //pass a anonymous function or callback into the each method, this means that each time a user is created, will create some fake questions for that user, we can define an argument in the callback to represent a single user, and get all questions for that user, since we want to create more than one questions, we can call saveMany and call another factory helper function in it,generate 1 to 5 questions for each user and call make method, not create since create() inserts records into database while make() generate objects and stored in memory
